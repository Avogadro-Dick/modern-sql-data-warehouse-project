# Modern-SQL-Data-Warehouse-Project

Welcome to the Modern-SQL-Data-Warehouse-Project repository.

This project demonstrates the end-to-end design and implementation of a modern data warehouse using SQL Server, covering the full lifecycle from raw data ingestion to analytics-ready datasets. It is designed as a portfolio-quality data engineering project that reflects industry standards, best practices, and real-world enterprise scenarios.

The primary goal of this project is to showcase practical expertise in data warehousing, ETL development, dimensional modeling, and analytical querying, similar to what is expected in professional data engineering roles.
